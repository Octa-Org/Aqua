# Vision

 - Have two forms of this langauge
    - Rift main langauge which is a compiler that produces LLVM IR
    - RiftI which is the transpiler (transpiles to C++ but as a scripting langauge)

 - Barebones language (no batteries included)
 - Seperate Libraries (Core, Security, Networking, GPU-Integration, ML, etc...)
 - Try new techniques from arxiv papers and measure benchmarks (possible make a paper)
